# Certificate

A certificate is used for encryption and communication between NTAK.guru and the government's NTAK system.
It is mandatory for every accommodation to have a live certificate in order to carry out reporting activities.

Technically, the certificate model is not available in the API.
However, it is important to understand the structure of the certificate object.

First, you need to generate a certificate for your accommodation, which will result in a pending certificate.
You can only have one pending certificate at a time. \
When you have a pending certificate, the `hasPendingCertificate{:json}` property in the accommodation object will be set to `true{:json}`.

While you have a pending certificate, you can download the certificate request file, `.CSR`. \
This file is used to generate the certificate in the government's NTAK system. \
Once the certificate is generated, you can upload the certificate file, `.CER`, to NTAK.guru. \
At this point, we will convert your pending certificate to a live certificate. The `hasPendingCertificate{:json}` property will be set to `false{:json}`, and the `hasLiveCertificate{:json}` property will be set to `true{:json}`.

The `.CER` file contains the following properties:

 * `name{:json}`: The name of the accommodation.
 * `providerName{:json}`: The name of the accommodation provider.
 * `providerTaxNumber{:json}`: The tax number of the accommodation provider.
 * `postalCode{:json}`: The postal code of the accommodation.
 * `locality{:json}`: The locality of the accommodation.
 * `reportingId{:json}`: The reporting ID of the accommodation.
 * `expireAt{:json}`: The expiration date of the certificate.

  Previously, we encountered an issue with the `.CSR` file. Occasionally, the government's NTAK system does not accept the `.CSR` file, even if the private key has been newly created.

  In such cases, it is necessary to delete the pending certificate and generate a new one.
