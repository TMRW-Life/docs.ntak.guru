# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the NTAK.guru API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. OAuth2 with a token.

## OAuth2 with bearer token

The recommended way to authenticate with the NTAK.guru API is by using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [NTAK.guru dashboard](https://app.ntak.guru/settings) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
```bash filename="Example request with bearer token"
curl https://api.ntak.guru/v1/accommodations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

<Callout>
Always keep your token safe and revoke it if you suspect it has been compromised.
</Callout>

## Using an SDK
If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [NTAK.guru dashboard](https://app.ntak.guru/settings), and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
