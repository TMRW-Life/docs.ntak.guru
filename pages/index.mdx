# Get Started

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the NTAK.guru API.
We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request.
We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Before you can make requests to the NTAK.guru API, you will need to grab your API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings Â» API](https://app.ntak.guru/settings/api).
</Callout>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use.
In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, NTAK.guru offers clients PHP.
In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'PHP']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh copy
    # cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
    curl --version
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh copy
    # Install the NTAK.guru PHP SDK
    composer require tmrw-life/ntak-guru-php-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Make your first request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the NTAK.guru API.
Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the NTAK reports endpoint to get a list of all your NTAK reports.
In the cURL example, results are limited to 25 report, the default page length for each client.

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'PHP']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh copy
    curl https://api.ntak.guru/v1/accommodations/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/reports/ntak \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
      -H "Accept: application/json" \
      -d perPage=25
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```php copy
    use TmrwLife\NtakGuru\Services\Reporting\Ntak;

    $ntak = Ntak::setup([
      'accessToken' => {token},
      'isProduction' => false, // default: false
    ]);

    $ntak->index('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', [
      'perPage' => 25,
    ]);
    ```
  </Tab>
