# NTAK Daily close

On this page, we will explore the process of programmatically constructing the NTAK daily close report.
We will delve into the steps and techniques required to build the report dynamically through code.

The NTAK daily close report differs from other reports in its generation process. It involves multiple steps:

<div className="relative w-full aspect-[2.61/1] mb-8">
  <Image src="/how-daily-close-works.svg" alt="How Daily close works" fill />
</div>

<Steps>
  ### NTAK.guru initiates a request to the government's NTAK system to retrieve the specific days for reporting.
  ### The government's NTAK system returns a list of dates for reporting.
    - If the list is empty, NTAK.guru will stop the entire process with success.
    - The list can contain up to 60 dates.
    - Dates can also be in the distant past
  ### NTAK.guru compiles concurrent requests based on the response received from the scheduler.
    - 3/1: 2024-09-01
    - 3/2: 2024-09-02
    - 3/x: 2024-09-05

    The number of concurrent requests can range from 1 to a maximum of 60 (the same amount as the list returned by the government's NTAK system).

    <Callout type="info">
      Concurrent requests are reducing the chance of errors in the reporting process.

      For example, if `3/2` responds with an error, `3/1` and `3/x` still could be sent to the government's NTAK system.
    </Callout>

  ### After receiving the all the responses from the PMS, NTAK.guru will compile the response and send it to the government's NTAK system.
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  What if the PMS has multiple accommodations connected to NTAK.guru?

  To avoid potential request spamming, (A.K.A. DDoS attacks), we implemented rate limiting. Currently, it is set to 1 accommodation per 15 seconds. \
  There is a chance that we will decrease the rate limit in the future, but it will never be lower than 1 accommodation per 5 seconds.
</Callout>

## Request

<Protocol method="POST" path="{accommodation-daily-close-url}" />

### Request Body

| Parameter | Description                                                                        |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `date`    | The date for which day data should be collected by the PMS for daily close report. |

### Authentication

To enhance the security of your endpoint, you have implemented a straightforward authorization mechanism.
The mechanism involves using a token that represents the accommodation ID, which is encrypted using OpenSSL and then base64 encoded.

Our [SDKs](/sdks) include the necessary public key for decryption purposes.
Additionally, the SDK offers a utility class that facilitates the decryption of the accommodation ID, ensuring secure and authorized access to your endpoint.

The content of the authorization header, after decryption:
```json copy
{
  "accommodation": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  In the event that the decryption process fails, it indicates an invalid token or that the request was not sent by NTAK.guru.
  __In such cases, it is important not to provide any data in the response.__

  To handle this situation, we recommend responding with a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code. This status code indicates that the request lacks valid authentication credentials or the provided credentials are insufficient. By returning a 401 status code, you can appropriately communicate to the client that the request is unauthorized and no data will be provided in response.
